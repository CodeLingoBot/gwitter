Gwitter is a Twitter client for the UNIX command line. Gwitter is written in Go. 

Current dependencies:
* Go oauth library writtebn by mrjones (https://github.com/mrjones/oauth) 
* Nothing else.

This project is currently a toy, but will be expanded over time into a fully functioning client. Contributions are much welcome!
